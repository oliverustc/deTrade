# Running the deTrade network

You can use the `./start-network.sh` script to stand up the deTrade network. The deTrade network has three peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service.

First ,  navigate to the folder :

```sh
cd /relpath/deTrade-network
```

Unlock the script :

```sh
sudo chmod +x ./start-network.sh
sudo chmod +x ./stop-network.sh
```

Start the deTrade network :

```bash
./start-network.sh
```

This script will automatically start the network , create channel "mychannel" and deploy the trade chaincode "datatrading".

Stop the deTrade network :

```sh
./stop-network.sh
```

Before you can deploy the deTrade network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.

## Using the Peer commands

The `start-network.sh` has alreafy imported the necessary environment virablesï¼š

```sh
# ROOTDIR:deTrade-network
export PATH=${ROOTDIR}/../bin:${PWD}/../bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${PWD}/../config/
```

```sh
export PATH=${PWD}/../bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD/../config/
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
```

Besides , the `/scripts/setOrgEnv.sh` script can be used to set up the environment variables for the organizations, this will help to be able to use the `peer` commands directly.

First, ensure that the peer binaries are on your path, and the Fabric Config path is set assuming that you're in the `deTrade-network` directory.

```bash
export PATH=${PWD}/../bin:${PWD}/../bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${PWD}/../config/
```

You can then set up the environment variables for each organization. The `./setOrgEnv.sh` command is designed to be run as follows.

```bash
export $(./scripts/setOrgEnv.sh Org2 | xargs)
```

(Note bash v4 is required for the scripts.)

You will now be able to run the `peer` commands in the context of Org2. If a different command prompt, you can run the same command with Org1 instead.
The `setOrgEnv` script outputs a series of `<name>=<value>` strings. These can then be fed into the export command for your current shell.

You can use the peer command to invoke the chaincode. Assuming that you are in the`deTrade-network` directory and chaincode name is "datatrading", you can use peer command  to init the ledger like this :

```sh
peer chaincode invoke \
  -o localhost:7050 \
  --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer0.orderer.example.com \
  --tls \
  --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer0.orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" \
  -C mychannel \
  -n datatrading \
  --peerAddresses localhost:7051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" \
  --peerAddresses localhost:8051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" \
  --peerAddresses localhost:9051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org3.example.com/peers/peer0.org3.example.com/tls/ca.crt" \
  -c '{"function":"InitLedger","Args":[]}'

```

You will see the output:

```sh
2024-12-10 02:38:55.978 UTC 0001 INFO [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery -> Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200
```

Invokde chaincode function:

```sh
peer chaincode invoke \
  -o localhost:7050 \
  --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer0.orderer.example.com \
  --tls \
  --cafile ${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer0.orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem \
  -C mychannel \
  -n datatrading \
  --peerAddresses localhost:7051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles ${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt \
  --peerAddresses localhost:8051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles ${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt \
  --peerAddresses localhost:9051 \
  --tlsRootCertFiles ${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org3.example.com/peers/peer0.org3.example.com/tls/ca.crt \
  -c '{"function":"createUser","Args":["ID","0"]}'

```

## Chaincode-as-a-service

To learn more about how to use the improvements to the Chaincode-as-a-service please see this [tutorial](./test-network/../CHAINCODE_AS_A_SERVICE_TUTORIAL.md). It is expected that this will move to augment the tutorial in the [Hyperledger Fabric ReadTheDocs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.4/cc_service.html)
